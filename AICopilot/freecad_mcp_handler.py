# FreeCAD Socket Server for MCP Communication
# Runs inside FreeCAD to receive commands from external MCP bridge
#
# Version: 5.8.0 - Multi-instance discovery via per-instance UUID +
#                   ~/.cache registry; GUI spawn + explicit freecad_binary;
#                   list_freecad_instances enriched with active doc + window
#                   title; startup banner shows handler version.
# Version: 6.2.0 - GUI-thread heartbeat (fast unresponsive-vs-busy diagnosis
#                   instead of a blind 30-120s timeout); active_connections +
#                   queue_depth surfaced on busy rejections and async job
#                   submission, so contention from another connected client
#                   is visible instead of presenting as an unexplained delay.
# Version: 7.0.0 - Assembly workbench support (containers, LCS, joints,
#                   grounding, solve, status/offset/limits); resolve_object
#                   extraction replacing ~200 sites of lookup boilerplate;
#                   CAM SIGSEGV fix (guarded FreeCADGui imports); capture_state
#                   gated off per-command by default; GIL/threading hardening
#                   across document ops and quit cleanup.
# Version: 7.1.0 - Reliability hardening: SIGPIPE ignored so long recomputes
#                   stop terminating FreeCAD; orphaned socket files swept on
#                   startup; MagicMock-shaped crash-log values fixed. Migrated
#                   to mcp 2.0's constructor-based handler registration. Added
#                   recompute/contains_point bridge operations and a cached,
#                   auditable GitHub release update check.
# Version: 7.2.0 - macOS bridge reliability: FreeCADCmd/headless_server.py
#                   discovery fixed for documented install locations;
#                   screenshot capture consolidated into the bridge and
#                   cropped to FreeCAD's window; reload_modules fixed to
#                   import freecad_mcp_handler under its real name. Docker
#                   image bumped to FreeCAD 1.1.3 and fixed a broken socket
#                   wait that made every container run time out.
# Version: 7.3.0 - execute_python() now surfaces FreeCAD Console warnings/
#                   errors (issue #49), not just Python stdout. CAM
#                   setup_stock CreateCylinder implemented; hole_wizard
#                   infers hole_type from operation; fillet's non-Body path
#                   now rejects out-of-range edges instead of silently
#                   dropping them; subtractive_loft and list_joints/
#                   get_part_status grounding visibility fixed. Broad
#                   integration test coverage expansion (assembly, fixture,
#                   continue_selection, and other previously-uncovered
#                   tools); fixed a real pipe-full deadlock in the CI test
#                   harness itself.
# Version: 7.4.0 - New varset_operations MCP tool: App::VarSet parametric
#                   variable containers (create/add/set/get property,
#                   enum options, list/remove property, bind_property,
#                   list_references), plus a full-review remediation pass
#                   on the new handler (a substring-match bug that could
#                   misattribute expression bindings between similarly-
#                   named properties; bind_property now validates the
#                   target property exists before binding; enum/list input
#                   validation; response pagination). list_references/
#                   remove_property's dependency-edge tracking is now
#                   actually functional against real FreeCAD -- it called
#                   getInListProp() as a method, but FreeCAD's binding
#                   exposes it as the InListProp property, so this had
#                   silently never worked on any FreeCAD build since it
#                   shipped. handler_registry.py extracted as the single
#                   source of truth for the handler class list (was
#                   hand-duplicated at 3 call sites); its hot-reload path
#                   fixed to re-import that registry too, so adding a new
#                   handler and hot-reloading no longer breaks every MCP
#                   command until FreeCAD is restarted. Closed out a batch
#                   of 29 Medium/Low findings deferred since 2026-07-18
#                   (most already fixed by unrelated commits; real fixes
#                   this pass: an api_introspection module-import allowlist
#                   closing a real path to introspecting arbitrary Python
#                   modules, spreadsheet cell-reference parsing/CSV BOM
#                   handling, torus self-intersection validation, and a
#                   test-mock rotation-composition fix). mcp dependency
#                   floor bumped to 2.1.1 (was 2.0.0), synced across
#                   pyproject.toml/requirements.txt/Dockerfile; pip bumped
#                   for PYSEC-2026-3721.
# Version: 7.4.1 - varset_ops.py cleanup pass from an independent code-review
#                   (5 findings the full-review pass above didn't cover):
#                   BaseHandler.resolve_object gained a type_id param,
#                   collapsing 8 hand-copied "TypeId != 'App::VarSet'" checks
#                   into the resolve call; new BaseHandler.bind_expression
#                   shared by VarSet and Spreadsheet bind_property, which had
#                   drifted into near-duplicates (Spreadsheet bindings now
#                   get the same post-recompute Invalid-state check VarSet's
#                   already had); remove_property no longer round-trips
#                   through list_references' JSON string or re-resolves the
#                   VarSet a second time; _PROP_DYNAMIC_BIT (a hardcoded
#                   FreeCAD-internal bit index) gets a one-time runtime
#                   sanity check that fails loudly instead of silently
#                   misclassifying properties if a future FreeCAD build ever
#                   renumbers it; set_property's MCP schema widened to accept
#                   array values for list-typed properties. Also bumped the
#                   dev-weekly CI pin to weekly-2026.08.26.
